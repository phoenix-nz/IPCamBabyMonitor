IPCamBabyMonitor
================

IPCam Baby Monitor is an Android App which uses your IP Camera as a baby monitor.
It will run in the background and alert you whenever the camera notes an alarm.
When running in the foreground you can use it like any IP-Camera viewer to watch (and listen to) your kid.

NOTE: Currently only supports Foscam IP-Cameras
